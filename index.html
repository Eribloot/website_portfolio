                <h3>Hello! I'm Eric!</h3>
                <p>Hello hello! I am currently a student studying software development!</p>
                <p>Before I started my studies, I had been working full-time in fast food customer service and as a full-time college student. I decided a few months ago to pursue a career in software development! I am looking forward to learning more about the topic and developing my skills. Feel free to check out my <a href = "https://github.com/Eribloot">GitHub</a> and look over what I have worked on so far.</p>
                <p class = "left">The languages I have spent time working with so far are:</p>
                <ol class = "left">
                    <li>C++</li>
                    <li>Javascript</li>
                    <li>Python</li>
                    <li>HTML/CSS</li>
                </ol>
                <p>I am currently residing in Livingston, Tennessee, and I can definitely foresee myself moving to the Nashville area within the next year or so.</p>

                <h3>A little bit about me</h3>
                <p>I have lived in several states most of my life, but spent much of my time in California. There, I completed a few years of college and learned about object-oriented programming. Now, I live with my family in Tennessee and I am studying software development as a student of <a href = "https://www.thinkful.com/">Thinkful</a> and learning more every day. Please reach out to me if you would like to collaborate!</p>
                <p class = "left">Some of my interests include:</p>
                <ul class = "left">
                    <li>singing alone in my car</li>
                    <li>fishing, hiking, camping; usually all three at once</li>
                    <li>programming silly projects</li>
                </ul>
